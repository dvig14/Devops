# Terraform Provisioners

This document explains how to use Terraform provisioners to perform post-deployment tasks such as pushing and executing scripts on a provisioned resource (e.g., an AWS EC2 instance).

---

## What are Provisioners?

Provisioners in Terraform allow you to execute scripts or commands on a local or remote machine as part of the resource creation process.

> **Note:**  
> Terraform can execute these scripts but cannot manage their state after execution. Itâ€™s better to use dedicated configuration management tools like Ansible, but provisioners can be helpful for bootstrapping or quick tasks.

## 1. Using `file` Provisioner

The `file` provisioner is used to upload a local file (e.g., a shell script) to the remote machine.

**Example Steps:**

- Create a script: `postinst.sh`
- Upload the script:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ... your EC2 config ...

  provisioner "file" {
    source      = "postinst.sh"
    destination = "/tmp/postinst.sh"
  }
}
```
> Ensure the destination folder exists; otherwise, it will throw an error.

## 2. Using `remote-exec` Provisioner

The remote-exec provisioner is used to execute commands on the remote machine using SSH.

**Example:**
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ... your EC2 config ...

  connection {
    type        = "ssh"
    user        = "root"
    private_key = file("<path-to-private-key>")
    host        = self.public_ip
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo yum update",
      "chmod +x /tmp/postinst.sh",
      "sudo /tmp/postinst.sh"
    ]
  }
}
```
> This provisioner connects via SSH using a private key, uploads a file with `file`, and then executes it remotely.

---

## 3. Using `local-exec` Provisioner

If you want to save outputs (like public IP) to a file, use a `local-exec` provisioner.

**Example**
```hcl 
resource "aws_instance" "server" {
  ami           = var.AMIS[var.REGION]
  instance_type = var.vm_size

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo ${self.public_ip} >> public-ip.txt"
  }
}
```
> This creates public-ip.txt with the public IP of the instance.

---

## 4. Tips
- Use /tmp or other always-accessible directories for file uploads.
- Terraform can't track whether a script executed successfully or if its effects are still valid.
